    See also disclaimer in .doc file of each software package.
  * don't use any GN utility for illegal purpose.

    only
  * It is not allowed to sell the programs or bundle them with commercial 
    or shareware products or shareware/freeware cdrom (see distribution rules)
  * It is not allowed to distribute modified programs or single files from  
    a compressed package
  * For commercial use or use in shareware products need permission 
    (see distribution rules)
  * Calling software utilities from selfmade software requires permission 
    if the selfmade software is distributed.
  * Send new ideas, bug reports directly to author by email. The
    author decides self which ideas are implemented or what is a bug
    and a feature.

2. Rules for Shareware GN utilities
===================================
  * Shareware utilities are not free, if you want to use the utility then
    must register the shareware product and pay the current registration 
    price. 
  * Shareware demo .zip are free for testing the software for limited time.
    GNMIDI, GNMIDFMT, GNKnow trial use are limited to 5 days,
    GNIStyle trial version is not time limited.
  * It is not allowed to use the trial versions as full versions by 
    knocking them up (cracking), this would be stealing.
  * It is not allowed to use (stolen) registration keys from others or 
    create own registration keys (hacking), such illegal keys are 
    not valid, this would be stealing.
  * After you tried the demo version with all its limits you decide if 
    you want register this shareware. 
  * If you want register then read readme.txt/liesmich.txt and 
    choose one of the payment methods. For direct payments to author
    you need to fill a registration form and send it with the payment to the
    author. For payments through a credit card registration service like 
    RegSoft.com, you need to fill the order form of the company correctly.
    Currently only RegSoft.com is legitimized to sell GN Shareware licenses.
  * For registering we need your full international postal address and 
    real name, optional email address. Without them no working license file 
    can be created.
  * If you don't want to register then you must delete all installations 
    of the shareware. You can try a future upgrade to check if you like 
    this one more.
  * Price can change so download newest demo to get current registration 
    conditions or ask the author by email.
  * The original (unmodified) demo .zip can be distributed by any media.
  * It is not allowed to distribute a registration license.
  * It is not allowed to modify the demo .zip file, nor to include or remove
    files.
  * Support will only be given to registered users by email.
  * license keys could change at new versions, legally registered users can 
    get a new key from author, keep old key in case that want use an old
    version again.
  * Bug reports and questions can be asked directly to author by email.
  * if a registered user violate against license conditions 
    (e.g. distribute key) then copyright laws of Austria apply to 
    judge the copyright violation. The users registration license will
    stop automatically, this user is then not allowed to use shareware key 
    and upgrades.
  * GNMIDI legally registered users can use GNMIDFMT too.
  * Legally registered users have permission to use the resulting MIDI files
    of the free DOS utilities for commercial use.
  * GNMIDI legally registered users have permission to use the resulting MIDI
    files for commercial use.
  * User is responsible to care about the copyright rules of existing MIDI 
    files (e.g. musical notes, lyrics, professional made MIDI songs),
    modifying an existing MIDI song with GN shareware software does not 
    change the copyright rules of the MIDI song. Even if modifying copyright 
    info in a MIDI file with GN software the MIDI file remains copyright of
    the original owners (author, composer, sequencer, company ...).
    Author is not responsible for users violating MIDI or songs copyright laws.

3.  Rules for use of C++ program sources
========================================
  * Source codes to most free DOS GN utilities can be licensed, also midiio source 
    library for reading/writing/copying/modifying/analysing MIDI files.
  * midiio source codes are required to compile most MIDI utilities.
  * It is not allowed to redistribute or resell the sources.
  * Sources are not available for any Open Source projects.
  * For any distribution of software or for any commercial or shareware use 
    of software  that uses GN modules you need to ask for permission (see 
    distribution rules). 

4. Distribution Rules 
============================
  * Distribution of Shareware demo .zip is allowed, it is not allowed to
    get paid for distribition. Distribution of Shareware registration 
    keys is prohibited.
  * Free for private noncommercial use utilities can be distributed, only
    .zip files that are not modified. It is not allowed to get paid for 
    distribution or bundle it with any commercial or shareware or freeware 
    product (e.g. software, cdrom, book, magazine...), you need permission
    for bundle any software.
  * To use any of the free or shareware GN midi utilities to generate 
    commercial midi files (e.g. produce and sell midi files, midi files 
    for use by a company - advertisement or presentation or company 
    homepage) GNMIDI Shareware must be registered.
  * For using utilities or sources in projects that are distributed 
    you need permission from author. Tell your project plans and which 
    GN utilities or sources are wanted to be used in project.
  * Author can give or deny permission to use utilities or sources in a 
    project, or limit permission for certain use inside a project. 
    Especially if project is competition against any GN utility or plan
    permission might be denied or limitted.
  * If you find utilities or sources to be useful in combination with your 
    project (that you want to distribute) then ask for permission and 
    conditions for including certain GN material into project,
    before starting with the project, because permission to distribute the 
    project with GN material is not guaranteed.
    
5. To simplify the rules to few sentences:
    * for any distribution that have to do with GN software,
      you need to ask author for permission
    * if you make a profit using GN software then share a 
      participation on profit with GN author
    * register GN shareware if you like it or delete it after trial use
    * register GN shareware if you use free GN utilities for creating 
      commercial midi files.
