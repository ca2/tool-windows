[0] FEATURES
    + reads a binary midi file of format 1 (needs to be valid)
    + writes a binary midi files of format 0 
    + combines all tracks of input into one track 
    + sorts events in order of time
    + careful merging of tracks that share same channel 

[1] BACKGROUND
Midi format 1 contains a tempo track and one or more singlechannel 
tracks that should be played together. Midi format 0 contains only
one track. Midi format 0 files are efficienter to handle for 
midi players because all events are directly one after the other.
For Midi 1 files the player must merge the midi commands from all tracks
in real time (in real time).
Most Midi players can't play format 1 files correctly. 
I noticed some typical types where many midi players fail:
 * The player refuses loading format 1 files and only accepts format 0 files
   (many keyboards, some software players)
 * The midi file format 1 contains masses of tracks (> 16, some produced
   over 100 tracks not each track really contained music)
 * The midi file contains some tracks that share the same channel 
   (e.g. percussion, drums)
   using different parameters (e.g. volume, effects) 
   The player might play it but does not care of the different track parameters
   (e.g. plays all those tracks with same program and same volume, effects...)

MIDI1TO0 produces a format 0 midi file that can solve these problems.
Using option -exact it is careful with track parameters so that most channel conflicts between
tracks are solved. Under some conditions this is not possible because of 
midi restrictions and is usually an error of the midi file author.

Standard midi restriction: 
  Two tracks cannot play same note on same channel at same time with 
  different note parameters (e.g. different programs)!
  The author must use different channels in such cases, or the note 
  will be played with only one of the conflicting parameter settings!

Information: 
  Sometimes careful merging of tracks sharing same channel can produce
  results with bad sound (e.g. loudness of a sound quickly changes between
  high and low). In such cases the conversion can not be done automatically
  because of channel conflicts. It would need to edit the original file first
  manually with a midi editor to solve the channel problems (use alternate 
  channels if possible, or try to use same parameters in these tracks, or 
  prevent playing notes on these tracks at same time.

Use MIDIFMT *.mid to show the version of midi files.

MIDI1TO0 was designed to handle 100% compatible midi files.
Normally the program stops when illegal or corrupt midifiles are 
used at input. 

Use MIDI1TO0 at your own risk.  Anything you do with MIDI1TO0 is your

You are here forewarned.

[5] INSTALLATION

[MSDOS]
Simply copy MIDI1TO0.EXE in a directory that is in your path.
When you start the program without arguments

C:\> MIDI1TO0

you should get the usage text (see next section)

[6] USAGE

usage: midi1to0 [-quiet] [-exact] srcfile.mid dstfile.mid
-quiet	be quiet, don't tell percentage
-exact	solve merging tracks with conflicting channel by
	refreshing all track parameters before playing notes
 midi1to0 merges channels into one track
 This program only converts format 1 midi files.
-quiet	be quiet, don't tell percentage
-exact	solve merging tracks of same channel by refreshing
  all parameters before playing notes.

MIDI1TO0 does not convert files that are not of format 1!
In this case the program prints the version and exits.

Warning: MIDI1TO0 does not warn about overwriting existing destfile.mid !

[9] USE
For example, you have a midi file example1.mid that you expect to be format 1.

MIDI1TO0 example1.mid example0.mid

If it is a format 2 midi, the program will stop with a message like that:
   "example1.mid is format 2. This program does not convert it to 0."

If it is a format 0 midi, the program will stop with a message like that:
   "example1.mid is already format 0"

If it is a format 1 midi, it will try to merge all tracks into example0.mid:
  23%  (counting from 0 to 100)
  "output written to example0.mid"

[10] CHANGES
v1.0 to v1.1:
  - added option -quiet (default is verbose)
    error messages are printed in all cases
  - modifications in midi input/output parser 
  - little bug fixed: some files produced more than one
    end of track messages inside format 0 track

v1.1 to v1.2:
  - using advanced midi parser midiio
  - added option -exact: careful merging of tracks with same channel (all channel and track
    parameters are stored and restored before playing notes).
  - added hidden option -version to shows program version
      usage:  midi1to0 -version

v1.2 to v1.3:
  - support long events (larger than 1 kb)

v1.3 to v1.4:
  - bug fix: program did not stop for certain truncated midi files.  

v1.4 to v1.5:
  - minor bug fix: conversion of pause at end of midi

v1.5 to v1.6:
  - more initialization for safety

v1.6 to v1.7:
  - help for users that are not able to use DOS utilities

v1.7 to v1.8:
  - remove port meta prefix commands which make no sense in format 0
  - remove tracknames that are not in first track
