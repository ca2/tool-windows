The best way to do this across bootup is to put it in the registry. Open regedit.exe and navigate to

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Session Manager \ DOS Devices

Add a new REG_SZ value and name it X: where X is your drive letter

The value should be the path in this form

\DosDevices\C:\Folder\Example
